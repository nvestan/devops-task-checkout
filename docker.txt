Docker provides container software that is ideal for developers and teams looking to get started and experimenting with container-based applications. Docker Desktop provides an integrated container-native development experience; it launches as an application from your Mac or Windows toolbar and provides access to the largest library of community and certified Linux and Windows Server content from Docker Hub.
